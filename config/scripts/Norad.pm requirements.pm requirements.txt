Norad.pm requirements

I am looking through the Norad.pm module and I think we need to modernize this module.  In the twenty years since the originator wrote this module, space flight has become much more common.  In fact, the Space Shuttle (aka 'STS') has flown and retired.  There are more satellites than ever and too many to consider processing uniquely.  Therefore, I propose that we look to modernize the Norad module along the following 'requirements'.  

1. Users will identify which satellites they want to plot by adding them to a satellite file.  The file name can be user's choice.  The data within the file will contain instructions for plotting the satellites.  The module should output a two-line element set (TLE) for each satellite in the user's list.  As an example, here are the content of the file iss.  There is no extension on the file so windows lists it as type 'File'.

There are two main sections to the user provided satellite file.  First is a header section, which will be a set of comments.  The second section consists of individual satellite configurations.  For example, satellite 25544 (the Norad designation for the International Space Station) has multiple lines, preceded by one blank line.  The number of lines is unknown, but there must be at least one per satellite.  The line must start with the Norad designated number for the satellite.  This is so we can retrieve the TLE data for that satellite.  We only need retrieve the ephemeris data for each listed satellite once per run.  The ephemeris data will be output in a file with the same file name as the user supplied file and with the extension '.TLE'.  
2.  # Key Steps
        # Check NORAD File Name:
        # The subroutine starts by checking if a NORAD file name is provided in the settings. If so, it constructs the file paths for the TLE and ISS files.
    # Download Satellite Data:
        # Data for different satellites (ISS, Hubble, STS, etc.) is downloaded using Globals::get_webpage from various URLs.
        # If the ISS download fails, the subroutine returns "FAILED".
    # Write TLE Data:
        # If data is successfully retrieved, it writes the combined TLE data (ISS, Hubble, and other sources) into the TLE file.
    # Process Satellite Data:
        # It processes the data from different satellites (STS, Soyuz, ISS, Hubble) and writes satellite-specific details, including 
        # their image paths and text descriptions, into the ISS file.
        # It also checks if the required image files exist, and if not, it updates them using update_file().
    # Return Values:
        # Returns "1" for success, "FAILED" for failure, and "what" in other cases.
3. Typical sources of data are as follows:
## NORAD SITES
#
# It's important to note what some of the abbreviations mean.  STS, for example is the Space Transportation System
# also called the Space Shuttle.  The Space Shuttle has been retired.  Other items should be added to the list.
# For example Blue Dragon or SpaceX.  Instructions on getting those sites need to be included in a readme file 
# somewhere.    
# iss = International Space Station
# css = Chinese Space Station
# hst = Hubble Space Telescope
# sts = Space Transportation System or Space Shuttle, now retired
#

my $iss_location = "https://www.celestrak.com/NORAD/elements/stations.txt";
my $other_locations1 = "https://www.celestrak.com/NORAD/elements/science.txt";
my $hst_location = "https://www.celestrak.com/NORAD/elements/tdrss.txt";

as you can see from the list, the satellite data files are all .txt files.  

4.  Basic assumptions
	a. the input file (user-provided) and the output file (.TLE file) will be located in the $xplanet_satellites_dir, as defined by the Globals.pm module
	b. the system should try to download the satellite data up to three additional times (3 retries) in the event of a failure.  Previously we used $MaxRetries = 3 as the setting.
	c. the system should not download more often than a set time frame.  Typically this is 12 hours but should be defined by a variable.  Previously we used $MaxDownloadFrequencyHours as the variable.  

	my $Satellite_file = "$xplanet_satellites_dir\\tm";
    my $SatellieTLE_file = "$xplanet_satellites_dir\\tm.tle";
    my $flag = 1;  # Initialize the flag, assuming the process will succeed unless conditions change.
    my $MaxDownloadFrequencyHours = 12;  # Maximum allowed time (in hours) between downloads of the TLE file.
    my $MaxRetries = 3;  # Maximum number of retry attempts in case of failure.
    my $tlefile = "$iss.tle";  # The TLE (Two-Line Element) file path for NORAD data (assumed to be set globally).

5. The .ini file contains settings that we should accomodate.  For example, let us presume that users will want to plot the locations of the ISS and the HST (Hubble Space Telescope).  The .ini file will be modified to read as follows:
#NORAD
#
NoradIssImage=iss_transparent.png
NoradIssText=ISS
NoradIssDetail=transparent={0,0,0} trail={orbit,-5,0,5} color=yellow altcirc=0 trail={orbit,-10,0,5}
NoradIssOnOff=On
NoradHstImage=hst_transparent.png
NoradHstText=HST
NoradHstDetail=transparent={0,0,0}
NoradHstOnOff=On
NoradSatImage=sat.png
NoradSatText=
NoradSatDetail=transparent={0,0,0}
NoradSatOnOff=On
NoradMiscOnOff=Off
NoradTleNumbers=
NoradMiscDetail=
NoradFileName=tm

This list of settings brings up a few ideas.  
5a. If there is no specific call for the ISS but the ISS switch is 'on':
If NoradIssOnOff = On, then assume that satellite 25544 is being requested and plan to return the ephemeris data as a TLE in the output.
5b. If NoradISSText = <some value>, then overlay that text instead of the text supplied by the $satellite_file (aka iss)
