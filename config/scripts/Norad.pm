## NORAD SITES
#
# It's important to note what some of the abbreviations mean.  STS, for example is the Space Transportation System
# also called the Space Shuttle.  The Space Shuttle has been retired.  Other items should be added to the list.
# For example Blue Dragon or SpaceX.  Instructions on getting those sites need to be included in a readme file 
# somewhere.  The sts files should be commented out and once I verify everything, I will do that.  
# iss = International Space Station
# css = Chinese Space Station
# hst = Hubble Space Telescope
# sts = Space Transportation System or Space Shuttle, now retired

    # Key Steps
        # Initialize Parameters:
            # $flag: Initially set to 1, assuming that the data retrieval process will proceed unless updated otherwise.
            # $MaxDownloadFrequencyHours: Defines how often (in hours) the system is allowed to download the TLE file.
            # $MaxRetries: Sets the maximum number of retry attempts in case of failure (though this variable isn't used in this subroutine).
        # File Existence Check: 
            # Uses -f to check if the TLE file exists. If it does, the stat function is used to retrieve file metadata, such as the file's last modified time and size.
        # Check File Freshness: 
            # The age of the file is compared to the maximum allowed download frequency (12 hours in this case). If the file is younger than that threshold, itâ€™s 
            # considered up to date, and the flag is set to 3.
        # Download or Check NORAD:
            # If the file is not up to date, the subroutine norad_checked() is called, which is likely responsible for either downloading new data or verifying its 
            # freshness from NORAD.
        # Return Value:
            # The subroutine returns a flag indicating the status of the TLE data retrieval. Depending on the situation, it could return 1 (initial value),
