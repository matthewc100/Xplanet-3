Documentation for Future Developers
Feature Description
The debug_print_modules utility in Globals.pm is a diagnostic tool that prints all registered modules and their settings. It is designed to assist in troubleshooting module initialization and ensure settings are correctly loaded from the .ini file.

When to Use
During module development to verify settings.
When debugging unexpected behavior related to configuration.
How to Extend
If future requirements involve filtering or conditional debugging (e.g., only printing specific modules), you can extend the utility by adding optional parameters.
